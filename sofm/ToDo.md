## ToDo

---

### New Metrics
1. Sid's metrics
2. Dependant on data sets
3. Train until metrics reach a certain value?
    1. Need to check metrics on other data sets to confirm they are proper benchmarks
### Different Data Set
1. Color Map
2. Animals
3. VQ
### Failure
1. Random failure of neruon(s)
    1. Fab failure
    2. Run-time failure

    1. Eliminate some of the neurons, where they are stuck in HRS or LRS, check with Sid and Andy
        1. Freeze weights 
        2. Set high, set low
    2. Bump up the learning rate?
        1. Threshold in firing of neurons, IE network hasn't seen this input before
### Testing
1. Eliminate Testing set?
    1. Train on full 5K
2. Add LR and Neighborhood to plot. I'd bet we'd see some pattern
3. Plot feature map every 100 epohcs
4. Change heatmap colors
### Hardware branch
1.
